# 2D-Rectangle-BST-
Background: Any applications areas such as computer graphics, geographic information systems, and VLSI design require the ability to store and query a collection of rectangles. In 2D, typical queries include the ability to find all rectangles that cover a query point or query rectangle and to report all intersections from among the set of rectangles. Adding and removing rectangles from the collection are also fundamental operations.  Purpose: For this project, you will create a simple spatial database for handling inserting, deleting, and performing queries on a collection of rectangles. The data structure used to store the collection will be the Binary Search Tree
